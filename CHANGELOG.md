## [Unreleased]

### Fix

- Run promxy as a non root user.

## [1.14.0] - 2022-02-16

### Changed

- Changed Ingress template to use at least `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` or `networking.k8s.io/v1` where available.

## [1.13.1] - 2021-09-13

### Fixed

- OAuth not working by adding a separate basic auth ingress.

## [0.13.0] - 2021-06-03

### Added

- Added dual-auth for Promxy at the root of the prometheus domain as OAuth2 is
